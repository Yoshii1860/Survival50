# Core Mechanics

**Wave-based Survival**: This is the core gameplay loop where players fight off increasingly difficult waves of zombies for as long as possible.

**Resource Management**: Players need to find and manage ammo for different weapons, adding a strategic layer to choosing engagements.

**Weapon Variety**: Players have access to different weapons with varying fire rates, damage output, and ammo capacity, encouraging tactical decision-making based on the situation.

**Randomized Spawning**: Unpredictable zombie spawns keep players on their toes and add an element of surprise.

**Difficulty Progression**: Over time, zombies spawn faster, forcing players to adapt their strategies and become more efficient at killing them.
